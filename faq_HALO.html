            Our records indicate that you did not upload a valid photo ID during
            your registration on HALO Exams. It shows that the headshot has been
            uploaded twice.

            Please send over a valid photo ID (driver's license, state ID or
            passport) to this email, and we will update your profile on HALO.
            Please be aware that we won't be able to proceed with approval of
            your exams without the photo ID as part of your profile. This is
            mainly because the exam is taken online, and we need to verify the
            identity of the individual taking the exam for compliance and
            issuance of any license(s).
